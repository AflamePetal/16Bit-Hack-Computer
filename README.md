# 16Bit-Hack-Computer
C implementation of the Hack computer and softwares from the "The Elements Of Computing Systems"
## Testing

You can test the provided executables of each program in the `test programs` folder.

Use your terminal and command-line arguments to run the programs:

- **VM_Translator:**
  ```sh
  vmtranslate <source file/files>/<source folder>
  ```
- **Compiler:**
  ```sh
  jc <source file/files>/<source folder>
  ```
- **Assembler:**
  ```sh
  assemble <source file>


Use _Logisim Evolution_ to run the _.circ_ file that is the implementation of the machine.

The compiler and the assembler work properly but the VM-Translator might have some bugs that I haven't yet noticed, but it was tested for small programs and worked well.
